# optimization-course
Jupyter notebooks used in my optimization courses - with some applications

Some notebooks are adapted from the oldest course Machine Learning by Andrew Ng from Coursera

Some notebooks are related with materials founded in internet

Current versions are using Python Language and eventually Julia.
